# Input: s = "00110011"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's 
# and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".

# "00110011" -> [2, 2, 2, 2], then min(every adjacent, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6)
# I don't even wanna write any code about this solution lol Bad interview question
