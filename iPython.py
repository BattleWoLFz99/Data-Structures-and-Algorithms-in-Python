    # iBinarySearch.py line 15 is elif, then else
    # NEVER DECLARING A VARIABLE IN IF STATEMENT, or better:
    #     Global variables are always at the beginning

# 1. Basic Operation:
    >>> 5 / 2
    2.5
    >>> 5//2
    2
    >>> 5 % 2
    1

# 2. You may use higher-order function, or:
    def isPalindrome(self, s, left, right):
        return True

    def validPalindrome(self, s):
        return self.isPalindrome(s, left + 1, right)

# 3. Use of \
    return self.isPalindrome(s, left + 1, right) or\
        self.isPalindrome(s, left, right - 1)

# 4. Always use 
    result = max(result, i)

# 5. string is None does not work, lst is None does not work
    if string == "":
        return -1
    if len(lst) == 0:
        return -1
    

# 6. enumerate()


# Python program to illustrate
    # enumerate function in loops
    l1 = ["eat","sleep","repeat"]
    
    # printing the tuples in object directly
    for ele in enumerate(l1):
        print (ele)
    print
    # changing index and printing separately
    for count,ele in enumerate(l1,100):
        print (count,ele)

    Output: 
    (0, 'eat')
    (1, 'sleep')
    (2, 'repeat')

    100 eat
    101 sleep
    102 repeat


# 7. The & operator in Python checks as a bitwise and. It does not short circuit.
# The and operator properly short circuits, which is the behavior you are looking
# for.
    if len(lst) != 0 and lst[1]:
        print("pass")

    if len(lst) != 0 & lst[1]:
        print("index out of range")
