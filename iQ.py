    # Maybe some comments
    # Code Quality
    # Bug Free
    # Logicality
    # perhaps ask: â€œWould you like me to add comments to this?
    # They might expect you to ask certain questions
    # What is the type of return

    # iBinarySearch.py line 15 is elif, then else
    # NEVER DECLARING A VARIABLE IN IF STATEMENT, or better:
